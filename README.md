GPT-2 From Scratch ðŸš€

I implemented GPT-2 from scratch in PyTorch, following the transformer architecture. This project was done as part of my AI learning journey to deeply understand how modern language models work.

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

Built the full GPT-2 model architecture manually (no Hugging Face shortcuts).

Implemented:

Tokenization & embeddings

Multi-head self-attention

Positional encodings

Transformer blocks with residual connections & layer norm

Causal masking for autoregressive text generation


ðŸ›  Tech Stack

Language: Python

Framework: PyTorch

Other Tools: NumPy, Matplotlib


âœ¨ Features

From-scratch transformer implementation

Text generation with autoregressive decoding

Supports customizable context length, vocab size, and number of layers

Educational, clean code for anyone learning LLMs


ðŸ“š Learning Outcome

As a student, this project helped me understand:

How attention mechanisms work internally

Why layer normalization & residuals are critical for deep models

The difference between training loss and actual text generation quality

Challenges of scaling (compute & dataset size)
